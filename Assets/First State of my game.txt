You're sitting in a smallish room at the top of a tallish tower of the Academy of Support Wizardry. You're just about to take a magic
coffee break when a sparrow flies into your window. The sparrow lands on your desk, and you can see a small scroll clutched in its beak. The sparrow stares at you.

1. Take the scroll.
2. Ignore the bird and make some magic coffee.
